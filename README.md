 In this project, I analyze a global restaurant dataset to uncover key insights about food service quality, customer satisfaction, and business performance.  Using data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, along with machine learning algorithms, I identify trends that can help restaurant owners and managers improve customer experiences and drive higher ratings.  This project demonstrates practical applications of data science in the food service industry and provides actionable recommendations based on real-world data.
